//! Gate is a game development library tailored to 2D pixel-art games.
//!
//! When creating a game, it is good practice to make a layer,
//! specific to one's needs, that separates the
//! game logic from the resource management, rendering, audio, and other interfacing
//! that is needed for a game.
//! "Gate" is the layer that I created for this purpose with my personal game development endeavors,
//! and I decided to make it public.
//! It should be noted that this library was developed for my own personal needs,
//! and is not meant to be a general purpose game development library.
//! This manifests itself mostly with the renderer, which is made specifically for 2D pixel art.
//! If your game has similar needs or you just want to get something going quickly,
//! then this library is for you.
//! If you have slightly different needs, then you can still use this code as a reference point.
//!
//! Users of this crate should create a build script in their project,
//! invoking functionality from the sibling crate "gate_build".
//! This will generate texture atlases and enums to reference assets.
//! See the "gate_build" crate for more details.
//!
//! # Example usage
//!
//! For a full example, see <https://github.com/SergiusIW/gate/tree/master/example>.
//!
//! # Future changes
//!
//! There are a number of new features I am planning to add to Gate in the future.
//! Some of these will involve breaking changes.
//!
//! * Loading assets on the fly
//! * Adding XBox controller input
//! * Generating enums/handles for user-specific assets, and loading those assets
//! * Handling game save data (currently only cookies in WebAssembly mode, nothing on desktop)
//! * Playing looping music that has a one-time intro, without any hiccups in the music
//!   (not sure how I'm going to do this, but it's important to me;
//!   game libraries often seem to overlook this fundamental feature)
//! * New renderer modes with new shaders
